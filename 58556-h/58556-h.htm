<div class="indent">From my girlish brow, that twilight in happy May;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Sweetheart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your hair outshines the light in the west;&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">Golden hair and golden sunset,&mdash;both are gray.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">

&#8217;Twas then he set this ring on my hand, as he murmured low,</div>
<div class="indent">Words that come back to me sweet and sad as my mother&#8217;s funeral hymn:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Dear hand, it shall guide me forevermore as now!&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">It is coarse with time and toil; it has lost its hold on him.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I think the sunsets now, are not so sweet and bright;</div>
<div class="indent">The sun dies now in the west, and his smile is sickly and worn,</div>
<div class="verse">Looking back o&#8217;er a waste of sand; it was such a different light</div>
<div class="indent">That hand in hand we watched &#8217;neath the blossoming thorn.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh that Northern village! how sheltered and calm it lay</div>
<div class="indent">At the foot of the green old mountain, nestling low.</div>
<div class="verse">Home of my wedded love; as fair and far away</div>
<div class="indent">It seems, as a city in Heaven to a toiling wretch below.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">How happy we were! and I know that I was dear</div>
<div class="indent">To him as his soul. I saw the shadow rise&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Small at first as my hand, but growing day by day,</div>
<div class="indent">As the smooth-faced saint beguiled him with honeyed lies.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But I was to be his own true wife to the end;</div>
<div class="indent">&#8220;Never but one,&#8221;&mdash;in this he was firm as a rock.</div>
<div class="verse">Of course he should have his way; oh! a noble friend</div>
<div class="indent">Was he; too wise to frighten her with an untimely shock.</div>
</div></div></div>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
Would I follow him? Yes, in a frail raft o&#8217;er the sea;</div>
<div class="indent">Or a savage&#8217;s hut&mdash;or a Bedouin&#8217;s roving tent;</div>
<div class="verse">What mattered it? he was so dear, so dear to me,</div>
<div class="indent">That my heart, my life, would go with him where&#8217;ere he went.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">
But the years I spent while the shadow day by day</div>
<div class="indent">Hung black above my head like a threatening doom;</div>
<div class="verse">The years I strove to thrust it with my weak hands away.</div>
<div class="indent">And marked it still descending, descending over my home.</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
And at last it fell! The shadow that long had frowned o&#8217;er me,</div>
<div class="indent">It fell; and I think my heart was benumbed with the blow;</div>
<div class="verse">Or perhaps &#8217;twas the look of a dove in her eyes; or maybe</div>
<div class="indent">I had no room in my heart for hate, but only for woe.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For I could not hate her, so sweet was her angel face;</div>
<div class="indent">She was only an innocent child, and he won her love;</div>
<div class="verse">And I knew too well&mdash;too well, what it was to place</div>
<div class="indent">His smile above all things, below, above.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
But like me, she had her day; I saw her dove-like eyes</div>
<div class="indent">Turn into the look of a hunted doe at bay;</div>
<div class="verse">When a haughty beauty with her dark, bold gaze,</div>
<div class="indent">Won his fickle heart from the English lass away.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And she holds him well; I fancy no &#8220;dream&#8221; will come,</div>
<div class="indent">No &#8220;holy revelation&#8221; he fears to wrong,</div>
<div class="verse">Bidding him take a fourth wife to his home;</div>
<div class="indent">She has a will that, if not saintly, is strong.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I am glad the pretty English flower is at rest</div>
<div class="indent">In a balmier land than lies &#8217;neath her own blue skies,</div>
<div class="verse">For never a storm will vex her in the vast</div>
<div class="indent">And sheltered valleys of God&#8217;s own Paradise.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To die of a broken heart,&mdash;that were too absurd!</div>
<div class="indent">&#8217;Twas a low and stubborn fever of which she died;</div>
<div class="verse">Against the holy faith she never spoke a word;</div>
<div class="indent">And her husband and his new wife watched faithfully by her side.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
Though they said that at last she drew her hands away</div>
<div class="indent">Even from him, and clasped them so wan and thin;</div>
<div class="verse">And the old nurse said she bent to hear her pray:</div>
<div class="indent">&#8220;Oh God, for Christ&#8217;s sake, forgive this Christless sin.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">What sent these thoughts to me in my lonely attic room</div>
<div class="indent">Where no step but mine falls through the night and day?</div>
<div class="verse">Perhaps &#8217;twas because I heard through the twilight gloom,</div>
<div class="indent">His voice in the garden below with his boys at play.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Their mother leaned from the porch to answer their merry call,</div>
<div class="indent">With a smile that made her proud face womanly and soft;</div>
<div class="verse">And they are two handsome lads;&mdash;when I go to the servants&#8217; hall</div>
<div class="indent">For my daily dole of bread and meat, I have met them oft.</div>

<div class="verse">
As their father chased them with laughter adown the winding walk,</div>
<div class="indent">Pelting them with red roses so gay this golden even&#8217;,</div>
<div class="verse">Did a murmur reach him through their childish talk,</div>
<div class="indent">Of our baby&#8217;s voice that is singing now in Heaven?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Had that child lived, I should not have been so lone;</div>
<div class="indent">Sitting here in my vacant room he would come to me,</div>
<div class="verse">A great tall lad, with his eyes of honest brown;</div>
<div class="indent">Cheering my desolate heart with his sympathy.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Though sometimes, I am glad he is safe within</div>
<div class="indent">The jasper gates that shut us so far apart;</div>
<div class="verse">With his father&#8217;s tender ways he will never win</div>
<div class="indent">Some woman&#8217;s love, only to break her heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But it is this wife, with her beauty and subtle art;</div>
<div class="indent">I like to think it is she who has poisoned his mind</div>
<div class="verse">Against me, for he had an affectionate heart</div>
<div class="indent">Before he became a saint; he was very gentle and kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">If I thought he would change, would come to me at last</div>
<div class="indent">And say: &#8220;Oh love, forgive me that my weak heart roved;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Forgive! Oh, in my happy tears I would wash out the past,</div>
<div class="indent">And love him better than ever man was loved.</div>

<div class="verse">
But it will not be, I shall dwell here alone till I die;</div>
<div class="indent">And some day my soul will fly from its prison bars</div>
<div class="verse">Over the dreary desert; I suppose that Heaven is as nigh;</div>
<div class="indent">But I wonder if I can be happy without him above the stars.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For I think this parting is final; he will not be mine again,</div>
<div class="indent">For they say there is no giving in marriage there above;</div>
<div class="verse">And should he and his three wives meet on the Heavenly plain,</div>
<div class="indent">Effaced by his fresher affections would be his old-time love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">If God would only let us change our natures at will;</div>
<div class="indent">If I had no heart I could better act my part;</div>
<div class="verse">Deserted, unloved wife, yet loving him, loving him still!</div>
<div class="indent">I think that a modern saint is better without a heart.</div>

When I die&mdash;what other hope do I have&mdash;he may come at last;</div>
<div class="indent">Perhaps he may even lay his hand on my brow</div>
<div class="verse">When &#8217;tis cold, and say: &#8220;It is long since past,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It seems as if I should know if he stood by my side;</div>

<div class="verse">But loveless, lonely dreamer, who will not be comforted;</div>
<div class="indent">Of what avail is it to murmur, to moan, or to cry;</div>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
