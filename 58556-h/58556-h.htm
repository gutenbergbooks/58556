<div class="verse1"><p class="drop-cap">FADED and thin is the hair he so lovingly pressed</p></div>
<div class="indent">From my girlish brow, that twilight in happy May;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Sweetheart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your hair outshines the light in the west;&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">Golden hair and golden sunset,&mdash;both are gray.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">

&#8217;Twas then he set this ring on my hand, as he murmured low,</div>
<div class="indent">Words that come back to me sweet and sad as my mother&#8217;s funeral hymn:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Dear hand, it shall guide me forevermore as now!&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">It is coarse with time and toil; it has lost its hold on him.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I think the sunsets now, are not so sweet and bright;</div>
<div class="indent">The sun dies now in the west, and his smile is sickly and worn,</div>
<div class="verse">Looking back o&#8217;er a waste of sand; it was such a different light</div>
<div class="indent">That hand in hand we watched &#8217;neath the blossoming thorn.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh that Northern village! how sheltered and calm it lay</div>
<div class="indent">At the foot of the green old mountain, nestling low.</div>
<div class="verse">Home of my wedded love; as fair and far away</div>
<div class="indent">It seems, as a city in Heaven to a toiling wretch below.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">How happy we were! and I know that I was dear</div>
<div class="indent">To him as his soul. I saw the shadow rise&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Small at first as my hand, but growing day by day,</div>
<div class="indent">As the smooth-faced saint beguiled him with honeyed lies.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But I was to be his own true wife to the end;</div>
<div class="indent">&#8220;Never but one,&#8221;&mdash;in this he was firm as a rock.</div>
<div class="verse">Of course he should have his way; oh! a noble friend</div>
<div class="indent">Was he; too wise to frighten her with an untimely shock.</div>
</div></div></div>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
Would I follow him? Yes, in a frail raft o&#8217;er the sea;</div>
<div class="indent">Or a savage&#8217;s hut&mdash;or a Bedouin&#8217;s roving tent;</div>
<div class="verse">What mattered it? he was so dear, so dear to me,</div>
<div class="indent">That my heart, my life, would go with him where&#8217;ere he went.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">
But the years I spent while the shadow day by day</div>
<div class="indent">Hung black above my head like a threatening doom;</div>
<div class="verse">The years I strove to thrust it with my weak hands away.</div>
<div class="indent">And marked it still descending, descending over my home.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
And at last it fell! The shadow that long had frowned o&#8217;er me,</div>
<div class="indent">It fell; and I think my heart was benumbed with the blow;</div>
<div class="verse">Or perhaps &#8217;twas the look of a dove in her eyes; or maybe</div>
<div class="indent">I had no room in my heart for hate, but only for woe.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For I could not hate her, so sweet was her angel face;</div>
<div class="indent">She was only an innocent child, and he won her love;</div>
<div class="verse">And I knew too well&mdash;too well, what it was to place</div>
<div class="indent">His smile above all things, below, above.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
But like me, she had her day; I saw her dove-like eyes</div>
<div class="indent">Turn into the look of a hunted doe at bay;</div>
<div class="verse">When a haughty beauty with her dark, bold gaze,</div>
<div class="indent">Won his fickle heart from the English lass away.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And she holds him well; I fancy no &#8220;dream&#8221; will come,</div>
<div class="indent">No &#8220;holy revelation&#8221; he fears to wrong,</div>
<div class="verse">Bidding him take a fourth wife to his home;</div>
<div class="indent">She has a will that, if not saintly, is strong.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I am glad the pretty English flower is at rest</div>
<div class="indent">In a balmier land than lies &#8217;neath her own blue skies,</div>
<div class="verse">For never a storm will vex her in the vast</div>
<div class="indent">And sheltered valleys of God&#8217;s own Paradise.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To die of a broken heart,&mdash;that were too absurd!</div>
<div class="indent">&#8217;Twas a low and stubborn fever of which she died;</div>
<div class="verse">Against the holy faith she never spoke a word;</div>
<div class="indent">And her husband and his new wife watched faithfully by her side.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
Though they said that at last she drew her hands away</div>
<div class="indent">Even from him, and clasped them so wan and thin;</div>
<div class="verse">And the old nurse said she bent to hear her pray:</div>
<div class="indent">&#8220;Oh God, for Christ&#8217;s sake, forgive this Christless sin.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">What sent these thoughts to me in my lonely attic room</div>
<div class="indent">Where no step but mine falls through the night and day?</div>
<div class="verse">Perhaps &#8217;twas because I heard through the twilight gloom,</div>
<div class="indent">His voice in the garden below with his boys at play.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Their mother leaned from the porch to answer their merry call,</div>
<div class="indent">With a smile that made her proud face womanly and soft;</div>
<div class="verse">And they are two handsome lads;&mdash;when I go to the servants&#8217; hall</div>
<div class="indent">For my daily dole of bread and meat, I have met them oft.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
As their father chased them with laughter adown the winding walk,</div>
<div class="indent">Pelting them with red roses so gay this golden even&#8217;,</div>
<div class="verse">Did a murmur reach him through their childish talk,</div>
<div class="indent">Of our baby&#8217;s voice that is singing now in Heaven?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Had that child lived, I should not have been so lone;</div>
<div class="indent">Sitting here in my vacant room he would come to me,</div>
<div class="verse">A great tall lad, with his eyes of honest brown;</div>
<div class="indent">Cheering my desolate heart with his sympathy.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Though sometimes, I am glad he is safe within</div>
<div class="indent">The jasper gates that shut us so far apart;</div>
<div class="verse">With his father&#8217;s tender ways he will never win</div>
<div class="indent">Some woman&#8217;s love, only to break her heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But it is this wife, with her beauty and subtle art;</div>
<div class="indent">I like to think it is she who has poisoned his mind</div>
<div class="verse">Against me, for he had an affectionate heart</div>
<div class="indent">Before he became a saint; he was very gentle and kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">If I thought he would change, would come to me at last</div>
<div class="indent">And say: &#8220;Oh love, forgive me that my weak heart roved;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Forgive! Oh, in my happy tears I would wash out the past,</div>
<div class="indent">And love him better than ever man was loved.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">
But it will not be, I shall dwell here alone till I die;</div>
<div class="indent">And some day my soul will fly from its prison bars</div>
<div class="verse">Over the dreary desert; I suppose that Heaven is as nigh;</div>
<div class="indent">But I wonder if I can be happy without him above the stars.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For I think this parting is final; he will not be mine again,</div>
<div class="indent">For they say there is no giving in marriage there above;</div>
<div class="verse">And should he and his three wives meet on the Heavenly plain,</div>
<div class="indent">Effaced by his fresher affections would be his old-time love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">If God would only let us change our natures at will;</div>
<div class="indent">If I had no heart I could better act my part;</div>
<div class="verse">Deserted, unloved wife, yet loving him, loving him still!</div>
<div class="indent">I think that a modern saint is better without a heart.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
When I die&mdash;what other hope do I have&mdash;he may come at last;</div>
<div class="indent">Perhaps he may even lay his hand on my brow</div>
<div class="verse">When &#8217;tis cold, and say: &#8220;It is long since past,</div>
<div class="indent">But she was dear to me in the long ago.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It seems as if I should know if he stood by my side;</div>
<div class="indent">Should feel on my face, did they fall, his remorseful tears;</div>
<div class="verse">That his voice, if loving,&mdash;no matter how long since I died&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">Would waken my heart from the silent sleep of years.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But loveless, lonely dreamer, who will not be comforted;</div>
<div class="indent">Of what avail is it to murmur, to moan, or to cry;</div>
<div class="verse">The peacefulest rest, I think, is the sleep of the dead,</div>
<div class="indent">When the day is past, and the darkness is over the sky.</div>
